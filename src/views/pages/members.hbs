            <h2 class="member-sub-header">Founder</h2>
            Chardee Galan is currently the project coordinator in Dr. Jeffrey Wood's lab at UCLA, which  focuses on developing, evaluating, and disseminating evidence-based treatment interventions for high functioning children with autism. However, she is broadly interested in youth with ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders, and she will be enrolling in a clinical Ph.D. program in the fall of 2014 to further pursue and refine these research interests. She has had an extensive history of leadership involvement, particularly in research contexts, serving as the Editor-in-Chief for the Undergraduate Journal of Psychology at Berkeley for two years (2010-2012), co-finding and directing UC Berkeley's first psychology undergraduate research conference (BerkPURC) for two years (2009-2011), and ultimately, creating one of UC Berkeley's first interdisciplinary research conferences for undergraduate students (BIRC; 2011-2012). In the spring of 2013, she assembled a group of highly talented undergraduate UCLA students to create the Undergraduate Research Journal of Psychology at UCLA, and she is extremely excited to be working with a group of such eager and ambitious students dedicated to empowering undergraduate students and disseminating scholarly research!
